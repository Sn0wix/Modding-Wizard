You can start a race by clicking the Play button at the top center of the viewport.

Navigate using `WASD`: `W` accelerates, `S` decelerates or drives backwards. `A` and `D` are used for steering. Only works with a physical keyboard!

Stay on the road, collect points, and beat your highscore!

Use the "View Rainbow Road Game Highscore" action to see your highscore.
